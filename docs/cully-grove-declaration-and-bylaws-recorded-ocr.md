7.1
Owner's Interest in Common Elements. Each Living Unit, Parking Unit and Craft Space Unit Owner shall be entitled to an undivided fractional ownership interest in the Common Elements, as described in this Section and on the attached Exhibit C. Each Owner of a covered Parking Unit, including Parking Units 1 through 6 and 11 through 16, shali be entitled to an undivided 0.094 percentage ownership interest in the Common Elements of the Condominium, as set forth on Exhibit C. Each Owner of an uncovered Parking Unit, including Parking Units 7 through 10 and 17 through 20, shall be entitled to an undivided 0.047 percent percentage ownership interest in the Common Elements of the Condominium, as set forth on Exhibit C. Each owner of a Craft Space Unit shall be entitled to an undivided 0.748 percent percentage ownership interest in the common elements of the Condominium, as set forth on Exhibit C. The remaining 97 percent interest in the Common Elements shall be allocated among the Living Units as follows: each Living Unit Owner shall be entitled to an undivided percentage ownership interest in the Common Elements of the Condominium determined by the ratio of the living area square footage of the first and second floors above grade for each Living Unit to the total living area square footage of all Living Units combined (exclusive of any unfinished basements, attics or crawl spaces). The living area square footage of each Living Unit was determined by the architects for the Condominium and equals the combined floor area of the Ist and 2nd floors of each Living Unit as measured from the outer surface of exterior wall framing and the middle of party walls between adjoining units. The living area square footage for each Living Unit is set forth on the attached Exhibit C.

7.2
Method of Allocation. The common profits and common expenses of the Property shall be allocated to each Unit according to the percentage of undivided interest in the Common Elements, as shown on the attached Exhibit C. As used in this Declaration, "common profits" means profits arising from the General Common Elements. Except upon termination of the Condominium or as otherwise provided in the Bylaws with respect to damage, destruction or condemnation, any common profits shall be used solely for the purpose of maintaining, repairing and replacing the Common Elements or for other expenses or reserves of the Association, Water and sewer expenses for the Condominium shall be paid by the Association. However, notwithstanding the general allocation of common expenses set forth above, each Unit shall have a submeter for measuring water and sewer usage and the Association shall bill each Unit Owner for such costs based on such submetered usage. Additionally, in the event an Owner of a Unit uses an unreasonably disproportionate amount of another service included in the common expenses, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, such Owner will be required to bear the expense of such service individually (as, for example, by separate metering of utilities) and the common expenses incurred by the other Owners will be adjusted by the Board accordingly. Certain other services provided through the Association, such as basic cable television service, may also be billed on a per-Unit basis rather than on the basis of Unit area, as determined by the Board in its reasonable discretion.

7.3
Commencement of Assessments. Assessments of common expenses shall commence upon closing of the first sale of a Unit, provided that Declarant may elect to defer the commencement of assessment of common expenses (other than assessments for reserves pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Bylaws) for a period of 60 days following such initial closing. Assessments for reserves pursuant to Section 13 of this Declaration and Section 6.2 of the Bylaws shall commence upon closing of the first sale of a Unit, subject to the right of Declarant to defer the payment of assessments for reserves pursuant to Section 13. Declarant shall give not less than 10 days' written notice to all Owners of the commencement of assessments of all common expenses. Until the commencement of assessments for all common expenses, Declarant shall be responsible for payment of all common expenses of the Association (other than assessment for reserves pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Bylaws). Except to the extent provided in the Bylaws, the common expenses of the Property shall be assessed on a monthly basis.

7.4
No Exception. No Owner may claim exemption from liability for contribution toward the common expenses by waiver by the Owner of the use or enjoyment of any of the Common Elements or by abandonment by the Owner of the Owner's Unit. No Owner may claim an offset against an assessment for common expenses for failure of the Board of Directors or Association to perform its obligations.

7.5
Default in Payment.

In the event of default by any Owner in paying to the Association the assessed common expenses (including, but not limited to, reserve assessments or any other special assessments) or any other amounts owing to the Association, such Owner shall be obligated to pay interest on such common expenses from the due date thereof, together with all expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Association in any proceeding brought to collect such unpaid expenses, or any appeal therefrom. No interest or late charges will be assessed on common expenses paid within 30 days after the due date therefore. Delinquent payments of common expense assessments shall bear interest from the date thereof at a rate equal to 18 percent, but in no event higher than the maximum rate permitted by law. The Board of Directors may also establish and impose charges for late payments of assessments, if the charge imposed is based upon a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors that is delivered to each Living Unit, mailed to the mailing address of each Living Unit, or mailed to the mailing addresses designated by the Owners in writing.

If the assessment is not paid within 30 days of its due date, the Board of Directors may declare any remaining installments of assessments for the balance of the fiscal year immediately due and payable and may terminate the right to receive utility services paid for out of assessments or the right of access to and use of recreational and service facilities of the Condominium until assessments have been brought current. The Board of Directors shall have the right and duty to recover for the Association such common expenses, together with interest thereon, late charges, if any, and expenses of the proceeding, including attorneys' fees, by an action brought against such Owner or by foreclosure of the lien which the Board of Directors shall have upon such Owner's Units with respect to all such obligations.

7.6
Foreclosure of Liens for Unpaid Common Expenses.

In any action brought by the Association to foreclose a lien on a Unit or Units because of unpaid assessments or charges, the Owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the use of the Unit or Units during the pendency of the suit, and the plaintiff in such foreclosure suit shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect such rental. The Board of Directors, acting on behalf of the Association, shall have the power to purchase such Unit or Units at the foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, vote the votes appurtenant to, convey, or otherwise deal with the Unit or Units. An action to recover a money judgment for unpaid common expenses shall be maintainable without foreclosing any lien securing the same.

7.7 Delinquent Assessment Deposit.

7.7.1
An Owner may be required by the Board, from time to time, to make and maintain a deposit of not less than one month's nor in excess of three months' estimated monthly assessments and charges, which may be collected in the same manner as other assessments and charges. Such deposit shall be held in a separate fund, be credited to the Unit owned by such Owner, and be for the purpose of establishing a reserve for delinquent assessments.

7.7.2
Resort may be had thereto at any time when such owner is 10 days or more delinquent in paying his monthly or other assessments and charges. Such deposits shall not be considered as advance payments of regular assessments.

In the event the Board should draw upon such deposit as a result of an Owner's delinquency in payment of any assessments, such Owner shall continue to be responsible for the immediate and full payment of such delinquent assessment (and all penalties and costs related thereto) and thus the full restoration of such deposit, and the Board shall continue to have all of the rights and remedies for enforcing such assessment payment and deposit restoration as provided by this Declaration and by law.

7.7.3
Upon the sale of a Unit, the seller/Owner thereof shall not be entitled to a refund from the Association of any deposit or reserve account made or maintained with respect to such Unit pursuant to this or any other Section of this Declaration; rather, any such deposit or reserve account shall continue to be held by the Association for the credit of such Unit, the Unit purchaser shall succeed to the benefit thereof, and the Unit seller shall be responsible for obtaining from the purchaser appropriate compensation therefore.

7.8
First Mortgages: Liability of Subsequent Purchaser. Any lien of the Association against a Unit or Units for assessments or charges shall be subordinate to tax and assessment liens and any first Mortgage of record, unless there has been compliance with all requirements of Section 100.450(7) of the Act. Where the purchaser or Mortgagee of a Unit or Units obtains title to the Unit or Units as a result of foreclosure of a first Mortgage or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, such purchaser or Mortgagee, his successors and assigns shall not be liable for any of the common expenses chargeable to such Unit or Units which became due prior to the acquisition of title to such Unit or Units by such purchaser or Mortgagee except to the extent provided in Section 100.475(2) of the Act; provided, in the case of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, that the Mortgagee complies with the requirements of Section 100.465(1) of the Act; and provided further, that any sale or transfer of a Unit pursuant to a foreclosure shall not relieve the purchaser or transferee of such Unit from liability for, nor such Unit or Units from the lien of, any cominon expenses thereafter becoming due.

In a voluntary conveyance of a Unit or Units (subject to the restrictions of this Declaration), the grantee shall be jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor of the Unit or Units to the time of grant of conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee therefore. However, upon request of a prospective purchaser, the Board of Directors shall make and deliver a statement of the unpaid assessments against the prospective grantor of the Unit or Units, and the grantee in such case shall not be liable for, nor shall the Unit or Units when conveyed be subject to, a lien filed thereafter for any unpaid assessments against the grantor in excess of the amounts therein set forth.

## 8. Voting Rights.

As set forth in Section 2.1 of the Bylaws, consensus is the primary method of decision-making at all levels of Association governance, except where otherwise required by the Declaration, these Bylaws, or the Act.

Declarant's Easements. Declarant has a non-exclusive easement to, through, and over the Common Elements as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of discharging Declarant's obligations or exercising special Declarant rights, whether arising under the Act or reserved in this Declaration.

28.6
Approval of Amendments. Declarant shall have the right to approve amendments proposed by the Owners to this Declaration, the Bylaws, the Plans, and the Rules and Regulations for so long as Declarant owns a Living Unit or for 10 years from the date this Declaration is recorded, whichever is latest.

28.7
Right of Review. Upon reasonable advance notice to the Board, Declarant shall have the perpetual right to review all inspection and maintenance records of the Association, including, without limitation, changes to the suggested maintenance schedule prepared by Declarant, if any.

In addition, upon request from Declarant, the Board shall provide Declarant at Declarant's cost copies of all inspection reports, proposed plans for alterations and copies of all warranty claims. As provided in Section 8.5 of the Bylaws, the Board shall provide Declarant with copies of submissions for alteration requests, advance notice of the Board's inspections of such alterations, and an opportunity for Declarant, its contractors or agents to accompany the Board's professional advisors on any such inspection.

28.8
Termination of Declarant Rights. Except as otherwise provided in this Declaration, the special Declarant rights set forth in this Section 28 shall continue for so long as
(i) Declarant is completing improvements which are within or may be added to this Condominium or (ii) Declarant owns any Living Units; provided, that Declarant may voluntarily terminate any or all of such rights at any time by recording an amendment to this Declaration, which amendment specifies which right is thereby terminated.

## 29. Miscellaneous.

29.1
Severability. Each provision of this Declaration and the Bylaws shall be deemed independent and severable, and the validity or partial invalidity of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining part of that or any other provision of this Declaration or the Bylaws.

29.2
No Impairment. The creation of this Condominium shall not be impaired and title to the Unit and Common Elements shall not be rendered unmarketable or otherwise affected by reason of any insignificant failure of this Declaration or the Plans or any amendment thereto to comply with the Act.

29.3.

No Partition. Except where permitted by the Act, the Common Elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of interest in the Common Elements made without the Unit to which that interest is allocated is void.

29.4
Subdivision. No Unit may be subdivided into divisions of any nature.

29.5
Relocation of Boundaries. Pursuant to ORS 100.137, the Owner or Owners of any two adjoining Units may apply to the Board of Directors of the Association for permission to change the sizes of their Units by adjusting the common boundary between the two Condominium Units or to consolidate the two Units into one Unit by deleting the common boundary. Any such application shall identify the Units involved, state any reallocations of the affected Unit's interest in common elements, or of Unit Owners' voting rights, liability for common expense, and right to receive common profits. The Board of Directors shall approve such an application unless it determines within 45 days (i) that the proposed reallocations are unreasonable, (ii) that the proposed relocation or deletion would impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems of the Condominium or would reduce the support of any portion of the Condominium, or (iii) that the proposed relocations or deletions would trigger any requirement for seismic upgrades of common elements under applicable building codes or any modification of the common elements will be required under applicable building codes or other applicable laws as a result of such relocations or deletions. The Board may require the Owners of the affected Units to submit an opinion of a registered architect or registered professional engineer that the proposed relocation or elimination will not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems of the Condominium or lessen the support of any portion of the Condominium. The Board or an agent appointed by the Board may supervise the work necessary to effect the boundary relocation or elimination.

If approved, a proposed change would become effective on recording in the appropriate records of Multnomah County, Oregon, of an amendment to this Declaration and to the Plans, both setting forth the change, executed by the Owners and Mortgagees of the affected Units and certified to by the chair and secretary of the Association, together with any governmental approvals required by law. All costs in connection with such amendments shall be paid by the applicants.

29.6
No Waiver of Strict Performance. The failure of the Board in any one or more instances to insist upon the strict performance of this Declaration, or of the Bylaws, or to exercise any right or option contained in such documents, or to serve any notice or to institute any action, shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of such term, covenant, condition, or restriction, but such term, covenant, condition, or restriction shall remain in full force and effect. The receipt by the Board of any assessment from an Owner, with knowledge of any such breach, shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach, and no waiver by the Board of any provision hereof shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by the Board.

29.7
Liability for Utility Failure, Etc. Except to the extent covered by insurance obtained by the Board pursuant to this Declaration and the Bylaws, neither the Association nor the Board nor Declarant shall be liable for:
(i) any failure of any utility or other service to be obtained and paid for by the Board; (ii) injury or damage to person or property caused by the elements, or (iii) inconvenience or discomfort resulting from any action taken to comply with any law, ordinance, or orders of a governmental authority. No diminution or abatement of common expense assessments shall be claimed or allowed for any such utility or service failure, or for such injury or damage, or for such inconvenience or discomfort.

29.8
Rule Against Perpetuities. The rule against perpetuities may not be applied to defeat any provisions of this Declaration or the Bylaws or Rules and Regulations.

29.9
Transfer of Declarant's Powers. Declarant, at any time in the exercise of its sole discretion, may sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or otherwise convey to any person, upon such terms and conditions as Declarant may determine, all of Declarant's rights, powers, privileges, and authority arising hereunder by virtue of Declarant's capacity as Declarant (which rights, powers, privileges, and authority are in addition to those arising from Declarant's ownership of one or more Living Units).

29.10
Sound Transmission Disclosure. Where condominium units are built either above or below each other, or side by side, it is normal to experience some transmissions of sound between those units from music, heels on noncarpeted floors, water traveling in drains, cupboard doors, and similar causes. On occasion these sounds are heard in normal conditions with typical noise levels. Owners should expect some transmission of sound between Units, Common Elements or from outside of the Condominium, including, without limitation, sound from the Portland International Airport. Declarant makes no warranty regarding soundproofing of Units and transmission of sounds between Units, Common Elements or from outside of the Condominium shall not be considered a construction defect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Declarant has caused this Declaration to be executed this 18 day of September, 2013.

The Condominium was established by Cully Grove LLC, an Oregon limited liability company (the "Declarant"), in accordance with the provisions of ORS Chapter 100 (the "Act"). The Condominium is located upon property in Multnomah County, Oregon, as more particularly described in the Declaration of Condominium Ownership for Cully Grove Condominium (the "Declaration"), which is being recorded simultaneously herewith in the records of Multnomah County, Oregon.

1.2
Bylaws Subject to Other Documents. The provisions of these Bylaws are applicable to the Condominium and are expressly subject to the terms, provisions, and conditions contained in the Articles of Incorporation of the Association (the "Articles") and in the Declaration.

1.3
Defined Terms. All defined terms used in these Bylaws and not specifically defined herein shall have the meaning given such terms in the Declaration.

1.4

All Owners; tenants and occupants of any Unit; and their respective agents, invitees, licensees, and employees that use the Condominium, or any part thereof, are subject to these Bylaws, and all rules and regulations thereunder as promulgated from time to time.

1.5
Office. The office of the Association shall be at 4779 NE Going St., Portland, OR 97218 or at any other place within Portland, Oregon designated by the Association.

## 2. Participation And Decision-Making

2.1
Consensus. Consensus is the primary method of decision-making at all levels of Association governance, except where otherwise required by the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Act. Using consensus, each member may agree with the matter, disagree with the matter but not block passage, or disagree with the matter and block consensus.

If agreed to by consensus at an Association meeting, decision making can be delegated to a committee or an individual. Members of the Association or the Board physically present or present via telephone at a meeting may participate in consensus polling during the course of such meeting. If consensus on a particular issue is not reached at two consecutive meetings, Section 3.8.2 shall govern.The Board of Directors may adopt Rules and Regulations pursuant to Section 8.25 below to further define how consensus decision-making will be conducted. The Board may also arrange for and require Members to participate in orientation trainings on the consensus decision-making process. Where the Declaration, these Bylaws, or the Act call for a vote on a particular issue, the process of moving from consensus to voting and the method for determining the applicable voting percentage are described in Section 3.8 of these Bylaws.

2.2
Responsibility of Membership. Each member of the Association shall be responsible for participating in the administration and management of the Association and in the maintenance of the Condominium social fabric and Common Elements. Such roles might include service on the Board, landscape maintenance, coordination or performance of work to maintain General Common Elements in good condition, compost management, planning social functions, or other functions as determined by the Board from time to time. Unless otherwise decided by the Board, the amount of time expected by the Owner(s) of a Living Unit with two or more adults will be greater than the time expected of a one adult household. The Board is empowered to create additional policies regarding participation or to provide an option for payment in lieu of participation.

## 3. Meetings Of Owners.

3.1
Administrative Control. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Bylaws, until the Turnover Meeting, the Declarant shall have the powers and authorities reserved to the Declarant in Section 20 of the Declaration.

3.2
Transitional Committee. Unless the Turnover Meeting has been held, the Declarant shall call a meeting of the Owners within 60 days after the conveyance to persons other than the Declarant of 50 percent of all 38 Units. Notice of the meeting shall be given as provided in Section 2.7 to each Owner at least 10 but not more than 50 days prior to the meeting.

The notice shall state the purpose, time, and place of the meeting.

If the meeting is not called by the Declarant within the time specified, the meeting may be called and notice given by any Owner.

If at the meeting the Owners other than the Declarant fail to select a transitional committee (the "Transitional Committee"), the Declarant shall have no further responsibility to form such a committee. The Transitional Committee shall be advisory only and shall consist of two or more members selected by Owners other than the Declarant and shall not include more than one representative of the Declarant. The members of the Transitional Committee shall serve until the Turnover Meeting. The Transitional Committee shall function to ease the transition from control of the administration of the Association by the Declarant to control by the Owners. The Transitional Committee shall have access to the information, documents, and records that the Declarant must turn over to the Owners pursuant to Section 3.3.

3.3.

Turnover Meeting. The Turnover Meeting, which shall constitute the initial meeting of the Association, shall be called by the Declarant within 90 days of the expiration of the period of Declarant's administrative control described in Section 20 of the Declaration. The Declarant shall give notice (as provided in Section 2.7) of the Turnover Meeting to cach Owner at least 10 but not more than 50 days prior to the meeting. The notice shall state the purpose, time, and place of the meeting.

If the meeting is not called by the Declarant, the meeting may be called and notice given by any Owner or by any first Mortgagee of a Unit. At the Turnover Meeting, the Declarant shall relinquish control of the administration of the Association to the Owners and the latter shall assume control; the Owners shall elect a board of directors as set forth in these Bylaws; and the Declarant shall deliver to the Association the items specified in Section 100.210(5) of the Act. During the three-month period following the Turnover Meeting, the Declarant or an informed representative thereof shall be available to meet with the Board on at least three mutually acceptable dates to review the documents delivered pursuant to Section 100.210(5)@) of the Act.

If the Declarant has complied with the terms of Section 100.210 of the Act, then, unless the Declarant otherwise has sufficient voting rights as an Owner to control the Association, the Declarant shall not be responsible for the failure of the Owners to comply with the provisions of Section 100.210(4) of the Act, and the Declarant shall be relieved of any further responsibility for the administration of the Association except as an Owner for any unsold Unit.

3.4
Annual Meetings.

In the twelfth month following the month in which the Turnover Meeting is held, the first annual meeting of Owners shall be held. Thereafter, annual meetings shall be held in the same month as the initial annual meeting or in the month following, at such hour and on such date as the Chairperson of the Board of Directors (the "Chairperson") may designate or, if the Chairperson fails to designate such date by the last day of the first month in which the meeting may be held, the meeting shall be held on the second Wednesday of the second month in which the meeting may be held, unless such date shall be a legal holiday, in which event the meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day. At such meetings, the Owners shall elect Directors to fill vacancies or to succeed retiring Directors as provided in Article 3 of these Bylaws and shall also transact such other business of the Association as may properly come before the meeting.

3.5
Place of Meetings. Meetings of the Owners shall be held at the principal office of the Association or at such other suitable and convenient place within the City of Portland, Oregon, as may be designated by the Board.

3.6
Special Meetings. At any annual meeting, the Association may decide to hold regular meetings of the Association more frequently than on an annual basis.

It shall be the duty of the Chairperson or Secretary of the Association ("Secretary") to call a special meeting of the Association if so directed by a majority of the Board or upon a petition signed and presented to the Secretary by the Owners of not less than 15 percent of the Living Units stating the purpose of the meeting, including the regular meetings on the schedule elected by the Association members at an annual meeting.

In addition, the Chairperson may elect to call a special meeting without being directed to do so by the Board or Owners. The notice of any special meeting shall state the purpose, time, and place of such meeting. No business shall be transacted at a special meeting except as stated in the notice.

3.7.
Notice. The Chairperson or Secretary shall give written notice of each meeting of the Association, at least 10 days but not more than 50 days prior to the date set for such meeting, stating the purpose, time, and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda (including the general nature of any proposed amendment to the Declaration or these Bylaws, any budget changes or proposal to remove a director or officer of the Association), to each Owner of record (and to any first Mortgagee of record requesting such notice), at the address or email address of such Owner as listed on the books of the Association, or at such other address or email address as such Owner shall have designated by notice in writing to the Chairperson or Secretary at least 10 days prior to the giving of such notice by the Chairperson or Secretary. The giving of a notice in the manner provided in these Bylaws shall be considered notice properly served. Proof of the giving of such notice, whether by mail, email or personal delivery, shall be given by the affidavit of the person giving the notice. For a period of 10 years following recording of the Declaration, notices of meetings shall also be given to Declarant in the same manner as given to Owners, and Declarant or a representative of Declarant shall be entitled to attend such meetings. Notice of a meeting may be waived by any Owner before or after a meeting. When a meeting is adjourned for less than 30 days, no notice of the adjourned meeting need be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment takes place.

3.8 Voting.

3.8.1
The total number of votes of all Owners shall be 16, which is equal to the total number of Living Units in the Condominium, and each Owner shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of Section 20 of the Declaration (which grants Declarant two times the votes for each Living Unit owned by it prior to the expiration of Declarant's administrative control described in Section 20 of the Declaration) and to Section 3.1 of these Bylaws regarding the election of Directors, to a number of votes equal to the number of votes allocated to the Living Units owned by such Owner. The Declarant shall be entitled to vote as the Owner of any Living Units retained by the Declarant.

3.8.2
If consensus decision-making applies and consensus cannot be reached on an issue after two meetings at which an issue has been discussed and at which formal consensus was attempted on that issue, a third meeting may be called and voting may be used.

A decision to hold a third meeting and to shift from consensus to voting shall require an affirmative vote of 50 percent of the voting power present at the second meeting.

A decision on such issue at the third meeting shall require an affirmative vote of 67 percent of the voting power present for the vote, or such other percentage required by the Act, these Bylaws or the Declaration.

Living Units owned by the Association do not vote and do not count in determining a quorum.

3.8.3.

If an Owner is in default under a first Mortgage on its Living Unit for 60 consecutive days or more and the Mortgage instrument signed by the Owner provides for such a pledge upon default, the Mortgagee shall automatically be authorized to declare at any time thereafter that the Living Unit Owner has pledged his or her vote on all issues to the Mortgagee during the continuance of the default.

If the Board has been notified of any such pledge to a Mortgagee, or in the event the record Owner or Owners have otherwise pledged their vote regarding special matters to a Mortgagee under a duly recorded Mortgage, only the vote of such Mortgagee or vendor will be recognized in regard to the special matters upon which the vote is so pledged, if a copy of the instrument with this pledge has been filed with the Board.

Amendments to this Section shall only be effective upon the written consent of all the voting Owners and their respective Mortgagees, if any.

3.8.4
If an Owner is in default for payment of assessments or other charges under these Bylaws, the Declaration or the Rules and Regulations for 60 consecutive days or more, the Owner's voting rights shall be suspended until such delinquencies are paid in full, including any interest, penalties or late charges due for such delinquency.

3.9
Absentee Ballots, Proxies and Other Methods of Voting.

A vote may be cast in person, by absentee ballot in compliance with ORS 100.422 (3), by written ballot in lieu of a meeting in accordance with ORS 100.425, by proxy, or by any other method specified by the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Act, including electronic ballot. A proxy given by an Owner to any person who represents such Owner at meetings of the Association shall be in writing, signed and dated by such Owner, may be given to any person or persons of legal age, and shall be filed with the Secretary.

A proxy shall terminate one year after its date (or earlier, if specified in the proxy), and every proxy shall automatically cease upon sale of a Living Unit by its Owner. Proxies must meet the requirements of ORS 100.427 (2) to be valid. An Owner may revoke such Owner's proxy only as provided in ORS 100.427. An Owner may pledge or assign such Owner's voting rights to a Mortgagee.

In such case, the Mortgagee or its designated representative shall be entitled to receive all notices to which the Owner is entitled hereunder and to exercise the Owner's voting rights from and after the date that the Mortgagee shall give written notice of such pledge or assignment to the Board of Directors. Any first Mortgagee may designate a representative to attend all or any meetings of the Association.

3.10
Fiduciary, Corporate and Joint Owners. An executor, administrator, conservator, guardian or trustee may vote, in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the Owners with respect to any Living Unit owned or held by him in such capacity, whether or not the same shall have been transferred to his or her name; provided, however, that he or she shall satisfy the Secretary that he or she is the executor, administrator, conservator, guardian or trustee holding such Living Unit in such capacity. Any person voting on behalf of a Living Unit owned by a corporation or other entity shall provide the Secretary with written evidence, satisfactory to the Secretary, that such person is the duly constituted representative thereof. Unless a valid court order establishes the authority of a co-Owner to vote, whenever any Living Unit is owned by two or more persons jointly, according to the records of the Association, the vote of such Living Unit may be exercised by any of the Owners then present, in the absence of protest by a co-Owner, In the event of disagreement among the co-Owners present, the vote of such Living Unit shall be divided equally among the number of Owners of such Living Unit present into fractional votes to be exercised by each such Owner present.

3.11
Quorum.

At any meeting of the Association, the presence, in person or by proxy, of a number of Owners holding 51 percent or more of the voting power of the Association shall constitute a quorum. The subsequent joinder of an Owner in the action taken at a meeting, evidenced by that Owner signing and concurring in the minutes thereof, shall constitute the presence of such person for the purpose of determining a quorum. When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it cannot be broken by the subsequent withdrawal of an Owner or Owners.

If any meeting of the Association cannot be organized because of lack of a quorum, the Owners who are present, either in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present; provided, however, that a quorum shall not be necessary to proceed with and hold a binding Turnover Meeting.

## 3.12 Binding Vote. The Vote Of More Than 67 Percent Of The Voting Power

present (whether in person or by proxy) at a meeting at which a quorum is constituted shall be binding upon all Owners for all purposes except where a higher percentage vote is required by law, the Declaration or these Bylaws.

3.13
Order of Business. Unless otherwise agreed by the Board, the order of business at an annual meeting of the Association shall be:

3.13.1
Calling of the roll and certifying of proxies;
3.13.2 Proof of notice of meeting or waiver of notice;

## 6. Budget, Expenses And Assessments.

6.1
Budget. The Board of Directors shall from time to time, at least annually, prepare a budget for the Association, estimate the common expenses expected to be incurred, less any previous overassessment, and assess the common expenses to each Owner in the manner set forth in the Declaration. The budget shall provide for an adequate reserve fund for major maintenance, repairs and replacement of those Common Elements, Association Property and any other property for which the Association is responsible that must be maintained, repaired or replaced on a periodic basis by the Association in accordance with Section 6.2 of these Bylaws.

The Board of Directors shall advise each Owner in writing of the amount of common expenses payable by him or her, and furnish a summary of each budget and amended budget on which such common expenses are based to all Owners and, if requested, to their Mortgagees, within 30 days after adoption of the budget. Failure to deliver a summary of any budget or amended budget to each Owner shall not affect the liability of any Owner for any such assessment.

Nothing herein contained shall be construed as restricting the right of the Board of Directors to, at any time, in their sole discretion, levy any additional assessment in the event that the budget originally adopted shall appear to be insufficient to pay costs and expenses of operation and management of the Condominium, or in the event of emergencies. Any budget for the Association prepared by Declarant or during the period of Declarant's administrative control of the Association pursuant to Section 20 of the Declaration shall be based on Declarant's reserve study, but such projection may vary substantially from the actual requirements of the Association for such period. The reserve study assumes that the Board conducts normal, routine maintenance for the elements reserved for and that the Board is required to perform pursuant to this Declaration, the Bylaws and the Act. If the Board fails to perform required maintenance, the reserve fund may be inadequate at the time of the required replacement for one or more elements included in the reserve study. After the Turnover Meeting, the Board of Directors shall be responsible, in its sole discretion, for preparation of the budget of the Association and shall not rely upon prior budgets or projections prepared by Declarant. The budget shall take into account the requirements of the Maintenance Plan adopted pursuant to Section 4.2.21.

6.2
Reserve Fund for Replacing Common Elements. Declarant shall conduct a reserve study as required by the Act and shall establish in the name of the Association a reserve fund for the major maintenance, repair and replacement of Common Elements, Association Property and any other property for which the Association is responsible that will normally require replacement in more than one and fewer than 30 years and exterior painting of Common Elements, as applicable. The reserve study shall not include the LCE Solar Equipment, which shall be maintained by the Owner of the Unit for whom such LCE Solar Equipment item is reserved. The common expenses of the Condominium shall be calculated on the basis of expected replacement costs and life expectancy of the items comprising the Common Elements, Association Property and any other property for which the Association is responsible that will normally require replacement in more than one and fewer than 30 years, and exterior painting of Common Elements, as applicable, such that the reserve fund is reasonably expected to provide sufficient funds for replacement of such Common Elements. Declarant in establishing the reserve fund shall obtain and rely on a reserve study in determining the amount of reserve assessments, but such projection may vary substantially from the actual requirements of the Association. Declarant may elect to defer payment of the assessments for the reserve fund with respect to a Unit until the time of conveyance of the Unit; provided that Declarant may not defer payment of such reserve assessments beyond the date of the Turnover Meeting, or, if no Turnover Meeting is held, the date the Owners assume administrative control of the Association.

The Board of Directors shall administer the reserve fund and shall adjust at regular intervals, but no less than annually, the amount of the periodic payments into it to reflect changes in current replacement costs over time. The Board of Directors shall annually conduct a reserve study or review and update an existing reserve study of the Common Elements, Association Property and any other property for which the Association is responsible to determine reserve account requirements. The reserve study shall include all information required by the Act.

Following the second year after the Turnover Meeting, the Association may by an affirmative vote of at least 75 percent of the Owners elect to reduce or increase future assessments for the reserve funds. Any funds established for any of the purposes mentioned in this Section shall be deemed to be a reserve fund notwithstanding that it may not be so designated by the Board of Directors. The amount of the reserve fund shail constitute an asset of the Association and shall not be distributed to any Owner except on termination of the Condominium and the Association.

The reserve fund is to be used only for replacement of the Common Elements, Association Property and any other property for which the Association is responsible that will normally require replacement in more than one and fewer than 30 years, and for the painting of exterior painted surfaces of Common Elements, as applicable, and is to be kept separate from the operating and special assessments. After the Turnover Meeting, however, the Board of Directors may borrow amounts from the reserve fund to meet high seasonal demands on funds obtained from regular assessments or to meet other unexpected increases in expenses that will later be paid from special or regular assessments, if the Board of Directors has adopted a resolution, which may be an annual continuing resolution, authorizing the borrowing of funds. Not later than the adoption of the budget for the following year, the Board shall adopt by resolution a repayment plan providing for repayment of the borrowed funds within a reasonable period. Repayment of such amounts borrowed from the reserve fund shall include any interest that would otherwise have been earned on such amounts. Assessments under this Section 6.2 shall be allocated as described in Section 7.2 of the Declaration and shall commence as described in Section 7.3 of the Declaration.

6.3
Determination of Common Expenses. Common expenses shall include:
6.3.1
Expenses of administration.
6.3.2

6.3.10 Any other materials, supplies, furniture, labor, services, maintenance, repairs, structural alterations or assessments that the Board of Directors is required to secure or pay for, pursuant to the terms of the Declaration or these Bylaws or that in its opinion shall be necessary or proper for the inspection, maintenance and operation of the Condominium as a first-class Condominium or for the enforcement of these restrictions, and that the Board of Directors determines should be assessed to the Owners under Section 6.4.

6.3.11
Paving, resurfacing, or restriping of parking areas, including, without limitation, the Parking Units.

6.3.12 The discharge of any mechanic's lien or other encumbrance levied against the entire Condominium or against the Common Elements or Association Property, rather than merely against the interests therein of particular Owners. Where one or more Owners are responsible for the existence of such lien, they shall be jointly and severally liable for the cost of discharging it and any costs incurred by the Board of Directors by reason of such lien or liens shall be specifically assessed to the responsible Owners.

6.3.13
Inspection, maintenance and repair of any Unit or Common Element if the Board of Directors determines that such inspection, maintenance or repair is necessary to protect the Common Elements or any other portion of the Property, and the Owner of such Unit (or the Owner responsible for maintenance of such Common Element, as applicable) has failed or refused to perform such maintenance or repair within a reasonable time afier written notice of the necessity of such maintenance or repair delivered by the Board of Directors to such Owner, provided that the Board of Directors shall levy a special assessment against such Owner for the cost of such maintenance or repair.

6.3.14 Expenses for shared food, social activities, trainings and conflict resolution services that have been approved by the Board or the Association.

6.3.15 Any other items properly chargeable as an expense of the Association, including, without limitation, those items described in the exhibits to the Declaration.

6.4
Assessment of Common Expenses.

All Owners shall be obliged to pay on a monthly basis in advance common expenses assessed to them by the Board of Directors on behalf of the Association pursuant to these Bylaws and the Declaration, including amounts applicable to the reserve fund described in Section 6.2 of these Bylaws; provided, however, that such reserve assessments may be collected on a monthly, quarterly, or biannual basis, and at least annually, and may be assessed prospectively or in arrears. Assessments shall be allocated in accordance with Section 7.2 of the Declaration. Assessments may not be waived due to limited use or nonuse of Common Elements. Declarant shall be assessed as the Owner of any unsold Unit, but such assessment shall be prorated to the date of sale of the Unit. Assessments shall commence in accordance with Section 7.2 of the Declaration.

At the time of closing of the initial and each subsequent sale of each Unit, the purchaser shall make the contribution described in Section 6.5.3 to the working capital fund. The Board of Directors, on behalf of the Association, shall assess the common expenses against the Owners from time to time, and at least annually, and shall take prompt action to collect from an Owner any common expense due that remains unpaid by him or her for more than 30 days from the due date for its payment (except as provided above for the Declarant).

6.5 Special Assessments.

6.5.1
Capital Improvements.

In the case of any duly authorized capital improvement to the Common Elements, the Board of Directors may by resolution establish separate assessments for the same, which may be treated as capital contributions by the Owners, and the proceeds of which shall be used only for the special capital improvements described in the resolution.

6.5.2
Other Reserve Trust Funds. The Board of Directors may also build up and maintain a reasonable reserve for contingencies and replacements not covered by Section
6.2 of these Bylaws. Extraordinary expenditures not originally included in the annual estimate that may become necessary during the year may also be charged against such reserve.

If the estimated cash requirement proves inadequate for any reason, including nonpayment of any Owner's assessment, the Board of Directors may at any time levy a further assessment, which shall be assessed to the Owners as provided in Section 7.2 of the Declaration. The Board of Directors shall serve notice of such further assessment on all Owners by a statement in writing giving the amount and reasons therefor, and such further assessment shall become effective with the first monthly assessment of common expenses that is due more than 30 days after the delivery or mailing of such notice of further assessment.

6.5.3.

Working Capital Fund.

Declarant shall establish in the name of the Association a working capital fund for the Association. Amounts paid into this fund shall not be considered advance payments of the monthly assessments for common expenses described in Section 6.4.

At the time of closing of each sale of each Unit, the purchaser of such Unit shall make an initial contribution to the working capital fund equal to two months of Association assessments for such Unit.

At or prior to the Turnover Meeting, Declarant shall transfer the amount of the working capital fund to the Association for deposit in a segregated fund and administration in accordance with Section 6.5.2. During the period of administrative control described in Section 20 of the Declaration, Declarant shall not use any funds contained in the working capital fund to defray Declarant's expenses, contributions to reserves, or construction costs, or to compensate for any deficits in the operating budget of the Condominium.

6.6
Violation by Owners; Remedies. The violation of any Rule or Regulation or other determination duly adopted by the Board of Directors, or the breach of any covenant or provision contained in the Declaration or these Bylaws, shall give the Association the right: (i) to enter upon that part of the Condominium where such violation or breach exists and summarily abate and remove, at the expense of the defaulting Owner, any structure, thing or condition that may exist thereon contrary to the intent and meaning of the provisions so violated, and the Association, or its agents, shall not thereby be deemed guilty in any manner of trespass;
provided, however, that the Association must institute legal proceedings before any item of construction may be altered or demolished in remedying such violation, (ii) to enjoin, abate or remedy by appropriate legal proceedings the continuance of any breach, and (iii) after giving written notice and an opportunity to be heard, levying reasonable fees, late charges, fines and/or interest against the Owners for violations of the Declaration, Bylaws, and/or Rules and Regulations, in addition to exercising any other rights or remedies provided for in the foregoing documents, based on a resolution of the Board of Directors that is delivered to each Living Unit, mailed to the mailing addresses designated in writing by the Owners, or mailed to the mailing address for each Living Unit. Any Owner aggrieved by such a violation shall also have the right, on behalf of the Association, to enjoin, abate, or remedy by appropriate legal proceedings any such violation and to recover its expenses in accordance with Section 12.1.

All expenses of the Association in connection with such violation and such action or proceedings (including any action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Association), including engineering, architectural and other professional fees and costs, court costs and attorneys' fees and any other fees and expenses (including fees, fines, late charges and interest imposed pursuant to these Bylaws), and all damages, liquidated or otherwise, together with interest thereon at the rate provided in Section 7.5 of the Declaration until the amount outstanding is paid, shall be charged to and assessed against such defaulting Owner and shall be added to and deemed part of his or her respective share of the common expenses.

Such liability shall include any increase in insurance rates occasioned by use, misuse, occupancy or abandonment of any Unit or its appurtenances.

Nothing in these Bylaws, however, shall be construed to modify any waiver by insurance companies of rights of subrogation. The expense of any such maintenance, repair or replacement shall be charged to the responsible Owner as a specific item, which shall be a lien against such Owner's Unit or Units with the same force and effect as if the charge were a part of the normal common expenses attributable to such Owner's Unit or Units.

6.8
No Waiver. The failure of the Association or of an Owner to enforce any right, provision, covenant or condition that may be granted by any of the provisions of the Declaration, these Bylaws or any Rules or Regulations shall not constitute a waiver of the right of the Association or an Owner to enforce such right, provision, covenant or condition in the future.

## 8. Occupation And Use.

8.1
Rental. The Leasing or Renting of a Living Unit by its Owner shall be govemed by the provisions of this Section 8.1. "Leasing or Renting" a Living Unit means the granting of a right to use or occupy a Living Unit, for a specified term or indefinite term (with rent reserved on a periodic basis), whether in exchange for the payment of rent (that is, money, property or other goods or services of value) or not; but shall not mean and include joint ownership of a Living Unit by means of joint tenancy, tenancy-in-common or other forms of coownership. With the exception of a lender in possession of a Living Unit following a default in a Mortgage, a foreclosure proceeding or any deed or other arrangement in lieu of a foreclosure, no Owner shall be permitted to Lease his or her Unit for hotel or transient purposes, which shall be defined as Renting for any period less than 30 days. Nothing in this Section 8.1 is intended to prevent an Owner from collecting rent or sharing expenses with a housemate so long as the Living Unit is also the primary residence of the Owner.

8.1.1
No Partial Leases. Except as allowed under Section 8.1 above, no Owner of a Living Unit may Lease less than the entire Unit.

8.1.2
Written Leases.

All Leasing, Rental or other occupancy agreements shall be in writing and be subject to the Declaration, these Bylaws and with the Rules and Regulations, if any (with a default by the tenant or occupant in complying with this Declaration, Bylaws or Rules and Regulations constituting a default under the Lease, Rental or occupancy agreements). Owners shall provide a copy of the Declaration, Bylaws and Rules and Regulations to their tenants at the time of entering into the Lease, Rental or other occupancy agreement and shall obtain a written acknowledgement from tenants acknowledging receipt of the documents.

8.1.3
Payments by Tenant or Lessee to Association. If a Unit is Rented, the Board may collect, and the tenant, lessee or occupant shall pay over to the Board, any amounts due to the Association hereunder for such Unit from the tenant, lessee or occupant, plus interest and costs if the same are in default over 30 days. The renter, lessee or occupant shall not have the right to question payment over to the Board. Such payment will discharge the lessee's, renter's or occupant's duty of payment to the Owner for rent, to the extent such payment is made to the Association, but will not discharge the liability of the Owner and the Unit under this Declaration for assessments and charges, or operate as an approval of the lease or occupancy agreement. The Board shall not exercise this power where a receiver has been appointed with respect to the Unit or its Owner, nor in derogation of any right which a Mortgagee of such Unit may have with respect to such rents.

8.1.4
Identification of Tenants. Each Owner electing to rent or grant occupancy of his or her Living Unit shall, within 10 days after the rental or occupancy of such Living Unit, submit to the Board in writing the identity of and contact information for such tenant or occupant.

At no time shall more than 25 percent of Living Units be rented or occupied by non-Owner occupants, provided that Living Units rented by an Owner who owns and occupies another Living Unit in the Condominium shall not be included in determining whether the 25 percent rental limitation has been reached.

In order to insure that the foregoing limitation is not exceeded, Owners who intend to rent or grant occupancy rights to their Living Units shall provide 30 days written notice to the Board of their intentions. Each such Owner may proceed to rent or grant occupancy to non-Owner occupants for his or her Living Unit unless such Owner is provided written notice of the Board's refusal to allow such rental or non-Owner occupancy because such rental or non~-Owner occupancy would exceed the limitation of the foregoing sentence.

In the event of such Board refusal, the requesting Owner shall not rent or grant non-Occupancy to any person until the Board notifies him or her that such rental or occupancy would not violate the limitation on non-Owner occupied Living Units. The Board shall maintain a list of Owners who requested and were denied the ability to rent or grant non-Owner occupancy of their Living Units, on a first-come, first-served basis and shall promptly notify each Owner on such list as it becomes permissible to rent or grant non-Owner occupancy of such Owner's Living Unit. By consensus or a vote of 75 percent of the Board, the Board may in its sole discretion, on a time limited, case-by case basis, remove the 25
percent rental limitation.

8.1.6
Violations by Tenant.

If any tenant of a Unit violates or permits the violation by his or her guests and invitees of any provisions of the Declaration, Bylaws or of the Rules and Regulations of the Association, and the Board determines that such violations have been repeated and that a prior notice to cease has been given, the Board may give notice to the tenant of the Unit and the Owner thereof to forthwith cease such violations; and if the violation is thereafter repeated, the Board shall have the authority, on behalf and at the expense of the Owner, to fine or evict the tenant if the Owner fails to do so after notice from the Board and an opportunity to be heard. The Owner and tenant shall be jointly and severally liable for any such violations of the Declaration, Bylaws or Rules and Regulations. The Board shall have no liability to an Owner or tenant for any eviction made in good faith. The Association shall have a lien against the Owner's Unit for any costs incurred by it in connection with such eviction, including reasonable attorney's fees, which may be collected and foreclosed under the terms of the Declaration.

Assistance by Tenants in Administration of the Condominium.

If the tenant and Owner of the Living Unit occupied by such tenant agree that the tenant will assist with the administration or maintenance of the Condominium on behalf of that Living Unit, as described in Section 2.2, the Owner shall notify the Board in writing of such agreement.

However, in the event the tenant does not participate in such manner, the Owner will be solely responsible for participate in licu or make a payment in licu to the Association, as determined by the Board of Directors.

8.1.8
Parking Units and Craft Space Units. Owners shal! indicate on the lease or rental agreement for a Living Unit whether Parking Units and/or Craft Space Units are included with the lease or rental. Owners may also lease Parking Units and/or Craft Space Units to other Owners in the Association so long as such leases are in writing and copies are provided to the Board of Directors, Owners may not lease Parking Units or Craft Space Units to any party who is not an Owner or tenant of a Living Unit.

In no instance shall the lease of a Parking Unit or Craft Space Unit release the Owner of such Unit from the responsibility of meeting maintenance requirements pursuant to Section 2.2 and paying assessments related to the Parking Unit or Craft Space Unit.

Without the prior consent of the Board of Directors, no more persons may live in a Living Unit on a permanent basis than is permitted by applicable law.

"home office" from which the Owner conducts some of his or her business affairs, so long as (a)
the Unit is not generally open to the public; (b) its use is limited to occasional visits by appointment-only customers, clients, or trade vendors; (c) and the Owner complies with all applicable laws in conducting such uses, including the City of Portland Zoning Code governing
"accessory home occupations."

x 16" visible from outside of the Craft Space Unit, and (b) the craft space use does not cause any infiltration of noise, radiation, vibration, fumes, odor or the like into other Units to any degree that would unreasonably interfere with other Unit Owners' use and enjoyment of their Units and/or Common Elements.

8.4

An Owner utilizing the colors, materials and fencing included in the Board's design guidelines shall not be required to obtain Board approval prior to commencing such work. Owners are advised that sewer drain lines are typically above basement floor elevations; hence, any future basement plumbing fixtures would require active pump/drain systems and associated permitting requirements.

The Board of Directors shall consider the granting of consent to any alteration proposed under this Section 8.6 only after the Owner shall submit a complete set of architectural, mechanical, electrical or other relevant plans and specifications, which submission shall be reviewed by such architects and engineers as the Board of Directors shall deem appropriate. The Board shall provide a copy of such submission materials to the Declarant upon receipt. Whether or not such consent is granted, the Owner shall pay, upon demand and in advance, if so required by the Board of Directors, for such professional review. During the course of construction and after completion of same, the Board of Directors shall cause its professional advisors to inspect the work to ensure that it is performed in compliance with the approved plans. The costs of such inspection(s) shall be paid by the Owner to the Board of Directors, upon demand.

8.11
Contested Legal Requirements. An Owner need not comply with any Legal Requirement so long as the Owner is contesting the validity or applicability thereof as provided in Section 8.10, provided that noncompliance shall not create a dangerous condition or constitute a crime or an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment, and that no part of the Condominium shall be subject to being condemned or vacated by reason of noncompliance or otherwise by reason of such contest.

Living Units; Solar Equipment.

All maintenance and replacement of and repairs to any Living Unit, Limited Common Element patio and roof over such Limited Common Element yard and patio area, any porch, porch stair or porch roof located within such Limited Common Element yard and patio area, and Limited Common Element Solar Equipment shall be made by the Owner of such Unit, who shall keep the same in good order, condition, and repair and shall do all maintenance activities which at any time may be necessary to maintain the good appearance and condition of his or her Unit(s) and shall maintain, repair and replace and keep the deck, porch or patio adjacent to or within the boundaries of his or her Living Unit and Limited Common Element yard and patio area clean and free of debris and standing water.

In addition, each Owner of a Living Unit shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, or replacement of the window glass, exterior doors, interior doors and door assemblies and any plumbing fixtures, fire sprinkler system (Living Units 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), range hoods, telephones, fans, lighting fixtures and lamps, refrigerators, dishwashers, ranges, or other appliances and accessories that may be in his or her Unit. Each Living Unit Owner shall maintain the window frames and window assemblies, trim, trellises, siding, flashing, roofing, gutters, exterior painting, downspouts, and solar equipment included as part of his or her Living Unit, subject to the following provisions applicable to attached Units within the same building (each, a "Building Structure"): Owners of Units within a Building Structure shall confer with one another prior to changing the exterior paint color or any materials used on the exterior of the Building Structure, provided that the consent of the other Owners within the Building Structure shall not be required except as otherwise provided below for certain elements of the Building Structure. Except as otherwise provided in the Declaration and Bylaws and subject to this Section 9.1.1, in the event repair or replacement of the common foundations of a Building Structure, common fireplace chase or common firewalls (which term shall have the same meaning as party walls) of a Building Structure should become necessary or appropriate, then the Owners of the affected Units within the Building Structure that require such repair or replacement shall be jointly responsible for such repair and/or replacement, and the Owners of such affected Units shall share equally in the expense of such repair and replacement.

In the event an Owner of a Unit in a Building Structure determines repair or replacement of the common foundations, common fireplace chase or common firewalls of such Building Structure is necessary or appropriate, that Owner shall notify the other Owners of the affected Units within the Building Structure of the need to perform such repair or replacement.

If a majority of the Owners of the affected Units within the Building Structure agree that such repair or replacement is necessary, they shall jointly cause such work to be performed, and each Owner of an affected Unit within such Building Structure shall pay an equal portion of the expense of such work.

If an Owner of an affected Unit determines repair or replacement of the common foundations, common fireplace chase or common firewalls of a Building Structure is necessary or appropriate and a majority of the Owners of the other Units affected or claimed to be affected do not concur with such determination, then the Owners of the Units affected (or claimed to be affected) shall mutually agree upon and retain a professional engineer licensed in the State of Oregon having at least five years experience in such matters to inspect the common foundations, common fireplace chase or common firewalls, and such engineer shall make a determination as to whether such repair or replacement is required. The determination of such engineer shall be binding on the affected Owners, and all expenses and fees of the engineer and of the repair or replacement work required to be performed, if any, shall be borne as provided in this Section.

In the event the Owners of Units so affected or claimed to be so affected cannot agree upon a professional engineer having the required qualifications within a 30 day period, then any of the affected Owners may make application to the Board of Directors, which shall select such engineer having the requisite qualifications. The fees and expenses of the engineer shall be shared equally by the Owners of the Units within the subject Building Structure.

In the event the Owner of an affected Unit fails to contribute to the expense of the engineer or the repair or replacement of the common foundation, common fireplace chase or common firewalls within 30 days after written demand therefor from another Unit Owner within the affected Building Structure, then the amount not paid or reimbursed, as weil as interest thereon at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date of such written demand, shall become a charge and lien against the Unit of the Owner failing to make such payment or reimbursement. Each Owner of a Unit in a Building Structure shall be deemed to have agreed, by acceptance of a deed conveying the Unit, that any such lien shall be effective, without the necessity of obtaining the joinder of such Owner in the execution of any instrument, upon the filing by another Owner of a Unit within the same Building Structure of a claim of lien in the Official Records of Multnomah County, Oregon. Any such lien may be foreclosed in the manner set forth in ORS 86.705 to 86.990.

9.1.2

In addition, each Owner of a Craft Space Unit shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, or replacement of the window glass, entry door and door assembly, and any flooring, stair treads, fans, lighting fixtures and lamps, or other appliances and accessories that may be in his or her Craft Space Unit.

However, should actual collection of such costs from the responsible Owner within a reasonable period of time prove impossible after reasonable collection efforts, the uncollected portion may be charged as a common expense in accordance with Section 7.2 of the Declaration, as such Declaration may be amended, subject to reimbursement of any amounts later collected from the responsible Owner. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Association shall be responsible for the inspection, painting, staining, maintenance, repair and replacement of the carport structures (exclusive of the Craft Space Units located therein), bike storage structures, trash enclosure, and Common House (including, without limitation, the inspection, repair and replacement of the roof, exterior doors, door frames and assemblies, window frames and assemblies); cleaning of the Common House interior, bike storage rooms, and all Association Property located therein; cleaning of the exterior surfaces of all window and door glass of the Common House; and the cutting, pruning, trimming, and watering of all landscaping on General Common Elements.

The Association shall indemnify its agents, employees and other of its representatives from any and all liability to any Owner incurred by reason of any reasonable exercise of the right of entry afforded in the Declaration or these Bylaws to effect emergency repairs. The Association shall have no liability to an Owner for any use of its right of entry or right to make emergency repairs if it shall have reasonable cause to believe that such action is required. An Owner shall be deemed to have consented to having such repairs done to his or her Unit by the Association. An Owner shall reimburse the Association in full for the cost of such repairs, except to the extent covered by insurance proceeds received by the Association, including any legal or collection costs incurred by the Association in order to collect the costs of such repairs.

All such sums of money shall bear interest from the due date therefor at the rate provided in Section 7.5 of the Declaration. The Association may collect all such sums of money in such installments as the Board of Directors may determine, which installments shall be added to the monthly contributions towards the common expenses of such Owner, after the Owner's receipt of notice thereof. All such payments are deemed to be additional contributions towards the common expenses and recoverable as such.

9.2

If the Association fails to follow the maintenance and inspection requirements contained in the Maintenance Plan described in Section 4.2.21 above, then the Association hereby waives any claim it might otherwise have against Declarant and its design professionals, contractors and subcontractors and their consultants, including without limitation, all of their officers, members, directors, employees, agents, brokers and affiliates, for loss or damage to the extent the same results from such failure to follow the Maintenance Plan, and shall indemnify such persons and entities from and against claims by Owners or other persons or entities for loss or damage resulting from such failure.

Votes of the Owners may be conducted by written ballot, in compliance with the procedures set forth in ORS 100.425. For votes of the Owners by written ballot, the Board of Directors shall provide Owners with at least 10 days' notice before written ballots are mailed or otherwise delivered.

Written ballots that are returned in secrecy envelopes may not be examined or counted before the deadline for returning ballots has passed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a secrecy envelope and signed return identification envelope shall not be required for the written ballot of an Owner whose consent or approval is required by the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Act.
